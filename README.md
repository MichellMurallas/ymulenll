### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for visiting my github profile!

ðŸ”­ I am a Software Engineer with more than 10 years of experience. I have worked on various projects using C++, PHP, C#, JavaScript, and other programming languages. Currently I am interested in, teach about and develop software solutions with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **ReactJs**, **NodeJS** and related technologies.

ðŸŒ± I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with the community, I am a teacher in an academy where I teach Front-End and Back-End courses focused on JavaScript technologies (React, Nodejs, MondoDB, Express, etc). In addition, I actively participate as a speaker in meetups and events. I also have a YouTube channel where I share content about software development (https://www.youtube.com/yoelvism).
